## Advanced Bird Classification Model

This model can classify **199 different bird species** using advanced deep learning techniques:

### Model Details:
- **Architecture**: Auto-detected EfficientNet (B2/B3) with enhanced regularization
- **Training Strategy**: Progressive training with advanced augmentation
- **Performance**: Optimized for accuracy and reliability
- **Dataset**: CUB-200-2011 (199 bird species)

### How to use:
1. Upload a clear image of a bird
2. The model will predict the top 5 most likely species
3. Confidence scores show the model's certainty

### Best Results Tips:
- Use high-quality, well-lit images
- Ensure the bird is clearly visible
- Close-up shots work better than distant ones
- Natural lighting produces better results

**Note**: This model was trained on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and works best with North American bird species.

### Technical Implementation:
- **Framework**: PyTorch with auto-detected EfficientNet backbone
- **Training**: Progressive training with advanced augmentation strategies
- **Regularization**: Optimized dropout rates and comprehensive validation
- **Image Size**: 320x320 pixels for optimal detail capture

### About the Model:
This bird classifier was developed using advanced machine learning techniques including:
- Transfer learning from ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet
- Progressive training strategy across multiple stages
- Advanced data augmentation for improved generalization
- Comprehensive evaluation and optimization

The model automatically detects the correct architecture (EfficientNet-B2 or B3) from the saved weights,
ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.
